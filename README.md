# Cervical Cytology AI — End-to-End Clinical Workflow Simulation (PoC)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This project builds an end-to-end AI system that simulates a **real clinical cervical cytology analysis workflow**.  
It ingests cytology microscope images, segments individual cells, classifies cell types, aggregates findings, and produces structured reports — similar to what an AI-assisted digital pathology system would do in practice.

> ⚠️ This project is a **research / portfolio proof-of-concept**.  
> It is NOT a medical device and NOT intended for clinical diagnosis.

## 🩺 Problem Context

Cervical cytology screening helps detect early precancerous cellular changes.  
Modern AI systems can support cytologists by:

- detecting and segmenting cells
- classifying cell morphological types
- highlighting suspicious cells
- providing statistical and structured reports

However, real clinical datasets and whole slide images (WSIs) are often restricted.  
This project simulates a realistic pipeline using open datasets and pseudo slide generation to demonstrate end-to-end system capability.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project aims to demonstrate:

✔️ A **production-like medical AI workflow**, not just a classifier  
✔️ End-to-end system engineering capability  
✔️ Reliable segmentation + classification performance  
✔️ Clinically relevant result summarization  
✔️ API readiness and deployment potential  

Target model performance: **≥ 92% accuracy** with strong recall for abnormal classes.

## 🧠 System Overview

### 1️⃣ Image / Slide Ingestion
- Loads cytology images from SIPaKMeD (and optionally Herlev / APC datasets)

### 2️⃣ Preprocessing
- color normalization  
- resizing & standardization  
- augmentation support  

### 3️⃣ Cell Segmentation
Uses:
- **CellPose** or **CellSAM**

Outputs:
- cell masks
- bounding boxes
- cropped cell patches

### 4️⃣ Cell Classification
Uses a lightweight deep network (MobileViT or similar) to classify:

- Dyskeratotic  
- Koilocytotic  
- Metaplastic  
- Parabasal  
- Superficial/Intermediate  

Achieved benchmark example: ~92–95% accuracy on SIPaKMeD.

### 5️⃣ Clinical Workflow Simulation
Because full WSIs are not publicly available, this project:

- generates **pseudo whole-slide images**
- tiles images
- runs segmentation + classification iteratively
- aggregates results to slide-level statistics

### 6️⃣ Reporting
Produces:

- counts of each cell type  
- abnormality ratios  
- highlight overlays  
- structured JSON report  
- optional PDF summary
